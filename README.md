Calorie-counting web application for the Northwestern dining halls. EECS 330: Human-Computer Interaction project. See deployment at: https://catcount.github.io/catcount/
## Problem
- People donâ€™t track calories largely due to the time-consumption and inconvenience
- Current dining website is clunky, having too many buttons and too much text to make the process of calorie tracking easy
## Solution
Create an easy-to-navigate app specific to the Northwestern dining halls that is able to track, calculate, and model calories and macronutrients consumed.
